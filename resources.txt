Gave good overview of how it all works.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain

to create an inheriting object:

var obj1 = {};
var obj2 = Object.create(obj1)
//obj1 is prototype of obj2 and any function of obj1 that uses "this" will refer to whichever called it
//changes to obj1 will be looked up on obj2 if obj2 is not assigned its own value
creating a constructed object

var obj1 = {};
var obj2 = New obj1();
/		/ i think obj2 inherits just the values of obj1 at the time of assignment, but then keeps its own copy.
//changes to obj1 never looked up by obj2?

Now just trying to solve this in order of error messages. Used:

to see what ctx.drawImage wants.
